# Curator 
Curator is a place to save your developer resources, like blog posts, tutuorials, and courses.

## Purpose
As developers, we are always calling on resources. We have a plethora of documents we need to access, from blog posts to cheat sheets to documentation. Considering the number of technologies and topics for which we keep these resources, the bookmarks bars on our browsers can easily become cluttered, especially if we store non-development related bookmarks there as well. Curator is a place dedicated to your software development bookmarks.
